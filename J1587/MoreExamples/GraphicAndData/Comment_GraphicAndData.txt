Graphic & Data Window
-----------------------------

This example shows some features of the graphic and data window. 
The configuration contains an Interactive Generator Block, which sends some
J1587 parameters, a graphic and a data window.

The desktop 'Graphic & Data' shows two different ways of displaying a signal 
value. If a signal is added to the graphic or data window, the sender MID of the 
corresponding J1708 message by default is undefined. In this case the display 
jumps between the values of all nodes sending this signal, see 'AxleGroupWeight 
all'. To only monitor the values of the signal from a specific MID the user must 
define the sender address of the signal (see 'AxleGroupWeight from 225' and 
'AxleGroupWeight from 226'). This can be done in the CANdb++ Editor or 
in the configuration dialog of the signal.
