J1587 System Demo
---------------------

This example configuration shows the main features of CANoe.J1587.

Note: A macro is replayed during measurement, which controls the panels. To control
the panels manually, disable the macro in View|Automation Sequences.

The simulation setup contains 5 nodes which simulate a powertrain of a heavy duty
vehicle. The nodes can be controlled via the panels on the 'Simulation' desktop.
The 'Parameter Monitor' is a J1587 specific window, which shows all parameter that
are transmitted by the nodes in the network.

The 'Diagnostics' desktop contains the J1587 DC Monitor and a trace window which
only shows the diagnostic messages. Use the panels on the 'Diagnostics' desktop
to produce diagnostic messages (by clicking on the OK switch).
