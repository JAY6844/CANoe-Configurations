FlexRay AUTOSAR Network Management 3.2 Protocol Demo
************************************************

This example demonstrates how to use the AUTOSAR FlexRay Network
Management node layer module in CANoe with a FIBEX database in
version 2.0 using FlexRay frames.

Four nodes (Nodes A-C, and a node called "Gateway") are included in the
simulation setup. The AUTOSAR FlexRay NM node layer DLL is assigned to
each of the nodes in the node's configuration, and the NM specific node
attributes are assigned using the INI file "FrYellow_AutosarFlexRayNM32.ini"
within the demo folder, e.g. adress and partial networking information.

The user can configure the state of the nodes A-C via panels. This includes
changing the network request state, the NM configuration ("Active Mode",
and "Partial Networking") and setting the user data and the control bit vector
sent. It is also possible to display the received user data and to order the
node to go to "Repeat Message" mode, which will trigger the detection of
other nodes. The detected nodes are displayed via LEDs in the panel.
Furthermore, the current NM state, the "Repeat Message" state
and reception of the "Car Wakeup" bit are displayed at the top of the panel.

The three main nodes belong to different partial networks, although, on a
FlexRay network, it is not possible to partially shut down the nodes. However,
you can determine the moment when a network is not requested any more
by observing the Write window for a "PnInactiveInd" event.

The "Gateway" node fills a special role, having the ability to send the
"Car Wakeup" bit to all nodes. The user can trigger this via another panel.
Note that unless the Car wakeup button is pressed, the gateway node is
passive and will not participate in the message transfer.
