FlexRay ISO Transport Protocol Demo
************************************

This demo illustrates the usage of the ISO 10681-2 FlexRay Transport Protocol Module for CANoe.
Pleae also refer to the CANoe Help for detailed information on the ISO TP DLL.

This example demonstrates how to use the ISO 10681-2 Transport Protocol in CANoe on FlexRay with a FIBEX database in version 3.0 using FlexRay PDUs.

Use the panels on the 'TP Demo Trace' desktops to send large data packets using a Transport Protocol.

You can change some settings for the Transport Protocol by using the "Additional Settings" button on the Node panels. For correct operation you must assure that the Transport Protocols settings match for both nodes.

The CANoe features are organized on individual desktops for better management and configuration.
