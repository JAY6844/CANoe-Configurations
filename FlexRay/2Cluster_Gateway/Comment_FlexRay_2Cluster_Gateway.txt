FlexRay 2 Cluster Gateway Demo
***************************

This sample configuration illustrates the simulation of two FlexRay networks that are interconnected by a FlexRay - FlexRay gateway.
This gateway is simulated by CANoe. Both FlexRay busses are assigned the same database (FIBEX) file. The ECUs of the "PowerTrain" bus are also simulated by CANoe and are distributed onto both busses:
Cluster 1: ECUs "Engine", "BLU" (Back Light Unit), and the "Gateway".
Cluster 2: ECUs "GearBox", "Dashboard", "BSC" (Brake System Control), and the "Gateway" again.

ATTENTION:
If you run this demo in 'Real bus' mode, then you must pay attention to the following requirements:
- 2 VN interfaces have to be connected to CANoe and must be mapped to channel FlexRay 1 and FlexRay 2.
- Do NOT connect any nodes to the interfaces! All nodes are currently simulated.
- Do NOT interconnect the FlexRay channels between the interfaces!
- You must connect the hardware synchronization line between both interfaces by a 'Sync cable'!
- You must enable the hardware synchronization in the hardware configuration settings of CANoe.
- Pay attention to the Write window that the hardware time synchronization works properly during run-time.

Functions:
The gateway is able to control the forwarding and to manipulate the payload of the forwarded frames.
Additionally the gateway is able to synchronize the clusters' time difference of the start of cycles to a requested value (Refer the Vector's Application Note on "FlexRay - FlexRay Synchronization with CANoe as Gateway").
The gateway also measures the routing delay of particular frames of both directions.
The routing delay depends on the clusters' offset to each other.

Configuration description:
The CANoe features are organized on individual desktops for better management 
and configuration. Explanations of the desktops and operating the sample 
configuration are listed in the CANoe Help under FlexRay Sample Configurations.
