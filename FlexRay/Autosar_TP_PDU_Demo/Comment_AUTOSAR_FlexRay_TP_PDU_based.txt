FlexRay AUTOSAR 3.0 Transport Protocol Demo
********************************************

This demo illustrates the usage of the AUTOSAR 3.0 FlexRay Transport Protocol Module for CANoe.
Refer also the PDF Manual for the AUTOSAR FrTP DLL.

This example demonstrates how to use the AUTOSAR 3.0 Transport Protocol in CANoe on FlexRay with a FIBEX database in version 3.0 using FlexRay PDUs.

ATTENTION:
The TP settings are not read from the FIBEX database! They are hard coded in the CAPL programs.

Configuration description
------------------------------
Use the TP panels on the 'TP Demo Trace' desktops to send huge data packets with
a Transport Protocol.

Press key '1' - '6' in order to start parallel transmissions for various scenarios.
Press key 'p' in order to switch between diagnostics and flash channel on all ECUs simultaneously.
Press key 'x' in order to clear the data in all TP panels.
Press key ' ' in order to show or key 'h' in order to hide all TP panels.

You can change some settings for the Transport Protocol by using the "Additional Settings" button on the TP panels. For correct operation you must assure that the Transport Protocols settings match for both nodes.

The CANoe features are organized on individual desktops for better management 
and configuration.
