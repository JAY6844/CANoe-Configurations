CAPL on Board Demo V 1.0
**********************

Environment:
This simulation only works with a VN7600 or VN3600 USB FlexRay interface connected to CANoe! It will NOT work in simulation mode or with any other interface.

Do not connect any real FlexRay Cluster or ECU to the FlexRay bus of the interface! Do not connect any real FlexRay Cluster or ECU to the FlexRay bus of the interface!

Simulation:
This demo generates two message counters in two event-triggered dynamic messages. The Counter_COB is generated by the ECU ESP, which is executed on the interface. The Counter_PC is generated by the ECU ACC on the PC.

A second scenario generates two responses in slot 7 and 9 on reception of slot 2 with node ESP. The node ESP is executed on the interface. The node ACC on the PC generates 8 responses in the slots 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, and 55.

Influence:
The ECU ECM, which is also executed on the PC, will produce a peak load on demand (button press).
Remark: High load on the PC can also be generated by other programs (Virus Scanner, Firewall, window operations on the GUI, etc.) besides CANoe.

Impact:
The high peak load on the PC will probably produce Slot Misses for the simulation on the PC.
Slot Misses result into cycle time deviations and/or data loss (missing of cycle counter values).

Result:
The simulation on the interface (COB) will not be affected. It will be exetuted deterministically!

The simulation on the interface (COB) has a significant better and deterministic response time than the simulation on the PC!
