VechicleHSFZ Demo
*****************
This demo configuration shows how you can use the High Speed Fahrzeug Zugang (HSFZ) protocol
in CANoe for simulation of a HSFZ/network gateway node or simulation of diagnostic servers.

The network node "GW" implements a HSFZ/CAN gateway by using the osek_tp.dll nodelayer
DLL for ISO TP communication on the CAN network and the nodelayer DLL DoIP.dll provided
in the \exec32 folder of CANoe for the diagnostic communication with the DoIP/HSFZ tester.

The CAN ISO TP network node "ECU" simulates a diagnostic server and uses the identical
source code as in the UDSSim sample configuration, as it is accessed by the external
HSFZ tester only via the HSFZ/CAN gateway "GW".

Note on running the HSFZ sample configurations:
To easier demonstrate how to implement a mere HSFZ tester, as well as how a network which
is accessed by HSFZ diagnostics should be configured, the sample configuration UDSSimHSFZ
has been split up into two additional sample configuration:
- TesterHSFZ: tester part of UDSSimHSFZ; shows how to configure and use CANoe as a
  HSFZ tester
- VehicleHSFZ: simulation part of UDSSimHSFZ; shows how to configure and use CANoe as
  a diagnostic simulation and how to implement a HSFZ/network gateway

To build up a realistic scenario, it is possible to
- start CANoe twice on the same machine and load one of the two mentioned
configurations into one instance of CANoe each, or
- run each of the two sample configurations on different machines and connect them by
  Ethernet (using a crossover cable or straight patch cable and a switch)
