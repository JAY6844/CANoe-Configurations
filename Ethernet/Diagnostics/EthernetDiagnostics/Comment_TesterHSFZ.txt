TesterHSFZ Demo
***************
This demo configuration shows how you can use the High Speed Fahrzeug Zugang (HSFZ) protocol
in CANoe for tester nodes (test modules / Diagnostic Console).

Desktop Download
Each CAPL test module uses the built-in HSFZ diagnostic channel by selecting one
target via the "SetDiagTarget()" command.
Since the targets along with their respective HSFZ parameters are defined in the
"ECU/Vehicle" tab of the Diagnostic / ISO TP configuration menu no further
configuration or programming of the HSFZ layer itself is neccessary in the tester nodes.

Desktop Diagnostic
For each configured diagnostic description, you will find one Diagnostic Console on this
desktop. Just as the CAPL test modules, the Diagnostic Consoles will use the built-in
HSFZ channel.

Note on running the HSFZ sample configurations:
To easier demonstrate how to implement a mere HSFZ tester, as well as how a network which
is accessed by HSFZ diagnostics should be configured, the sample configuration UDSSimHSFZ
has been split up into two additional sample configuration:
- TesterHSFZ: tester part of UDSSimHSFZ; shows how to configure and use CANoe as a
  HSFZ tester
- VehicleHSFZ: simulation part of UDSSimHSFZ; shows how to configure and use CANoe as
  a diagnostic simulation and how to implement a HSFZ/network gateway

To build up a realistic scenario, it is possible to
- start CANoe twice on the same machine and load one of the two mentioned
configurations into one instance of CANoe each, or
- run each of the two sample configurations on different machines and connect them by
  Ethernet (using a crossover cable or straight patch cable and a switch)
