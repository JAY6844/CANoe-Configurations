Address claiming
-------------------------

This configuration demonstrates the address claiming. On measurement start
all three nodes sends an address claiming parameter group.

The J1939 Scanner displays all nodes on the bus. Use the scanner or the node
panels to change the address of a node.

Node1 has the highest priority and therefore it will always win the address claim
against other nodes.
Priority of the Node2 is lower than the priority of the Node 1, but higher than the priority of the Node3
But the Node2 cannot change its address and therefore will lose the address claim against Node1, but win against the Node3.
Node3 has the lowest priority, but can change its address to the free one.
