Signal & Graphic window
-----------------------------

This example shows some J1939 specific features of the graphic and data window.
The configuration contains an Interactive Generator Block, which sends some
parameter groups and several Graphic & Data windows.

The desktop 'Graphic & Data with different senders' shows what happens, if a
signal is transmitted from two different senders. If a signal is added to the
graphic or data window, the sender address of the Parameter Group is normaly not
defined. In this case the display jumps between the values of the different
senders, see signal Torque_Mix.
The user must define the sender address of the signal. This can be done in the
CANdb++ Editor or in the configuration dialog of the signal. The graphic and
data window can now display the signal correct, see Torque_From_3 and 
Torque_From_91.

The desktop 'Graphic & Data with Error signals and Not Available signals' shows what
happens, if the signal contains the error value (254) or the not available value (255).
The data window has an indicator that shows the state of the value with colors (green=valid, yellow=not available and red=error).
