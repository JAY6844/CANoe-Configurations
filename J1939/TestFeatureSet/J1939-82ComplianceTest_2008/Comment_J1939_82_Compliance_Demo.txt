J1939 Compliance Test 2008 Example
-----------------------------------

This example demonstrates the J1939 Compliance Test base on the specification
in the yeaar 2008. The configuration simulates two nodes. 
For the EBS Node, there can be a J1939 Compliance Test generated. 

The TPMS node is needed as a orignator of requests and as a responder for transport protocol messages.  

To generate a J1939 Compliance Test for the EBS node, have a look to the "Learn more about the creation..."-Panel. Please click on the questionmark to get a detailed step-by-step guidance for the creation.

The EBS Node can be manipulated by the "Mistakes"  panel. The panel modifies the implementation of the EBS node to produce built-in mistakes. These mistakes lead to a negative verdict of the J1939 Compliance Test.

Press the 'Start Test' button on the testmodules interface  to start the test.  After the test the verdict is displayed (PASSED or FAILED).
 
After measurement stop, press the '"Report"-Button to open the test report in a browser.

The J1939 Compliance Test can always be regenerated from the J1939 Testmodule Manager in the CANdb++ Editor.
