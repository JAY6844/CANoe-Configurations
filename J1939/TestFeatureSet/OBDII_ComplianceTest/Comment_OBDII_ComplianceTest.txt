ODB II Compliance Test Demo
------------------------------------

OBD II Compliance Test for a J1939 network based on J1939-84 draft document from December 2008

The 'Setup' desktop shows the J1939 network with a simulated node (EMS). The test setup shows the test nodes that execute the compliance test.

The 'Test' desktop shows 2 panels, one to influence the 'EMS' node and one to give additional information to the test node and start the test.
When the button 'Start ODBII Compliance Test' is pressed the test module is started and can be observed in the test execution window.

During the execution the tester is asked for information or manual steps by dialogs.
Finally there is a test protocol generated that informs the user about the detailed results of the test.
