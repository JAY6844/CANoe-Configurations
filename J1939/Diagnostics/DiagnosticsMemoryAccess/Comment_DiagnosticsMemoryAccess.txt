Diagnostics Memory Access
---------------------------------

This configuration demonstrates the usage of the Diagnostics Memory Access
Window. This window is a node in the simulation setup. It can read data of a device
and write data to a device via diagnostics messages (SAE J1939-73).

The simulation setup contains the Diagnostics Memory Access Window, a simulated
device (TPMS)  and a node, which calculates a dynamic key for the Memory Access
Window. 

After measurement start you can read and write objects of the device by clicking
the buttons on page 'Object Access' of the  Diagnostics Memory Access Window. After
the request (DM14) the device responses with DM15 and a seed. The required key is
calculated by MemAccUtil.can and sent back to the device which responses a second
time. Then the data is transmitted via DM 16 and the connection is closed. 

Getting or setting data at a certain address of the device memory is done on page
'Direct Access' and periodically access of objects is enabled on page 'Cyclic Access'.
