Truck Overview
-------------------

This configuration contains several panels which show sets of common signals used in
a standard J1939 network. This configuration is intended to be used with a live bus
and it helps the user by displaying a quick overview of many of the signal values present in the network.

The panels are arranged by relevance on separate Desktops:

"Truck at a Glance...":  
This Desktop contains a mock-dashboard with information which would normally be
present on an Instrument Cluster. Additional signals tied to specific Electronic Control
Units are displayed in their respective panels below the dashboard
(Engine Information, Transmission Information, and Brake Controller Information).

"Aftertreatment System":  
Contains an overview of the signals typically found in an Aftertreatment System.
The diagram depicted is inspired by "FIGURE SPN1761 – Example Aftertreatment
System Schematic" from J1939-71 Jan 2009.

"Battery Information":
Contains a signal value overview of the complete Battery systems as depicted by
"FIGURE PGN65104_A – BATTERY INFORMATION" using the signals in "FIGURE PGN65104_B – BATTERY INFORMATION LEGEND" from J1939-71 Jan 2009.
