 vFlash Automation Sample Configuration
##########################################

------------------------------
TARGETS

The sample configuration shows how you can flash a control unit from CANoe. The control unit can be flashed 
from CANoe test modules.

The vFlash program will thus be remote controlled via its automation interface. 
You can then use vFlash to flash previously generated 'vFlashPacks' to a control unit. 
With just a few adjustments you can also flash via LIN and FlexRay as well as via CAN.

------------------------------
USING THE SAMPLE CONFIGURATION LOCALLY (CAN)

1) Install CANoe and vFlash 3.5 or newer.
If you have installed vFlash the first time, you have to restart Windows.

2) Start CANoe.

3) Make the following settings in the 'Network Hardware Config' dialog 
(call via Control Panel or the menu path Configuration|Network Hardware|[Driver...]:

   - connect vFlash CAN1 to one channel 
   - connect CANoe CAN1 to another channel 
   - when not using a real ECU, connect both channels with a wire

4) Open the configuration vFlashNodeLayer.cfg

5) Start the measurement.

6) On the 'Flash ECU' desktop start a test case.


------------------------------
USING THE SAMPLE CONFIGURATION IN A NETWORK (CAN)

You can use the sample configuration via remote (RT) on a computer in the LAN. For this do the following:

On the Remote PC:
 
1) Install CANoe and vFlash 3.5 or newer.
CANoe may not be installed here: C:\Programme (x86)\.
If you have installed vFlash the first time, you have to restart Windows.

2) Make the following settings in the 'Network Hardware Config' dialog 
  (call via Control Panel or the menu path Configuration|Network Hardware|[Drivers...]:

   - connect vFlash CAN1 to one channel 
   - connect CANoe CAN1 to another channel 
   - when not using a real ECU, connect both channels with a wire

3) Start the runtime server with: <CANoe>\Exec32\RuntimeServer.EXE

4) After finishing the sample configuration stop the runtime server with the command 'unregserver'.


On the Local PC:

1) Start CANoe.

2) In the CAPL code of the test module, adapt the path in the variable „gFlashpack“ to your vFlashPack path, e.g. “C:\flashpacks\Demo.vflashpack”.

3) Connect to RT-PC:

   - Menu path Configuration|Options|Extensions|CANoe RT 
   - Activate the 'Run CANoe RT on the remote Computer' option. 
   - Select RT-PC from the list. 
   - Click the 'Connect' button.

4) Start the test module

Note:
- If the test module's path to the flash package (vFlashPack) is relative, then it is relative to 'gWorkingDir' on the RT-PC.


------------------------------
USING THE SAMPLE CONFIGURATION ON A VN8900 OR VT SYSTEM (CAN)

You can use the sample configuration on a VN8900 or VT System Realtime Module in standalone mode.

vFlash Installation on VN8900/VT System (if not already available):

1) Start CANoe's Platform Manager or open the Vector Tool Platform dialog and connect to the VN8900/VT System via USB or Ethernet.

2) Go to the vFlash page and click the "Update" button.

3) Select the vFlash VN8900 Setup Package (e.g. "vFlash3.5.vn89" from the vFlash Setup CD).

4) Confirm installation.


vFlash Configuration on the VN8900/VT System:

In order to use vFlash a flash package (vFlashPack) needs to be available on the VN8900/VT System and vFlash needs to be assigned to a communication channel.

Download the sample vFlash project file:

1) Start CANoe's Platform Manager or open the Vector Tool Platform dialog and connect to the VN8900/VT System via USB or Ethernet.

2) Go to the vFlash page and click "Add..." button.

3) Select the "demo.vflashpack" file from the sample configuration folder.


Assign vFlash communication channel on a VT System:

1) Connect to the VT System with a Remote Desktop Connection.

2) Open the Vector Hardware Config.

3) Assign "vFlash" and "CANoe" to different CAN hardware channels that are physically interconnected with a CAN loop cable.


Assign vFlash communication channel on a VN8900

1) Connect the VN8900 via USB to your PC.

2) Open the Vector Hardware Config and assign "vFlash" and "CANoe" to different CAN hardware channels that are physically interconnected with a CAN loop cable.


------------------------------
NOTES FOR CUSTOMIZING THE SAMPLE CONFIGURATION

With CAN you are able to set the flash baud rate in the CAPL test with the variable 'gFlashingBaudRate'.
With LIN and FlexRay the baud rate cannot be changed during measurement.

You can define the flash package setting the variable 'gFlashpack' in the CAPL test. The path can only be absolute.

With LIN and FlexRay you can use the demo flash packages from the sample configuration of the vFlash installation.


------------------------------
BAUD RATE

The baud rate is often increased during flashing via CAN compared to normal operation. 
The flash baud rate is specified in vFlash and saved in the flash pack. 
The current baud rate can be read out, checked, and if necessary set in the CAPL test module prior to flashing. 
Likewise it can also be reset after flashing. The commands for this are:

canGetConfiguration(channel, settings);
canSetConfiguration(channel, settings);

A example is contained in the test module of the sample configuration; 
see /test/Baudrate.cin in 'SetBaudRate'.
