IO Hardware Demo 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This configuration demonstrates the capabilities of third party IO Hardware.
It uses the pl_demo.dll which emulates an analog/digital I/O device.
The pl_demo.dll includes several signal generators. These generators can be 
configured over the pl_demo.ini file which can be found in the CANoe 
application data folder.
