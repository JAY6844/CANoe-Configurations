ABSMatlab Demo 
**************
This is an example for using MATLAB/Simulink(R) together with CANoe for modelling and ECU behavior as well as defining tests.

The Realtime Workshop of MATLAB/Simulink (R) was used to generate nodelayer DLLs which are attached to the simulation setup.

The chassis node contains a Simulink model which implments the brake behavior of a vehicle. The brake process can be performed with or with out ABS. With the speed entry you set a start speed from which the braking should occur.

To simplify the usage a test configuration was integrated to stimulate the two brake scenarios. The test module is started on measurement start of the demo.

The Simulink(R) model consists of a subsystem which is enabled as soon as the brake pedal in the control panel is pressed. With the ABS on/off switch you select whether ABS should be active or not.

The Graphic windows on the Measurement desktop show the stopping distance (xF) for full braking, the wheel slip (lambda) which is lambda = (vF-vR)/vF, where the wheel speed is vR and the vehicle speed is vF.

Within the Parameterization desktop you can modify the value for the vehicle mass and watch how the values for the brake distance differ. Another Graphic window displays the model internal value FR which is the output test point of Gain Block 3.

The Model desktop shows the Simulink(R) models with the Model Viewer. You can navigate through the models including subsystems. System variables which were generated by parameterization can be dragged and dropped onto analysis windows.

The test desktop shows a test module with some tests which are implemented with Simulink models. For the manipulations of the set points the panel TestManipulation can be used.

The first test checks the brake distance for a brake sequence with and without ABS. For checking the brake distance a Simulink model with a dynamic upper bound check is used.
