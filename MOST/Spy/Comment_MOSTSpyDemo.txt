-------------------------- MOST Spy Demo ----------------------------------------

This sample works in real mode with 1 MOST channels in pure spy mode.

To operate this demo, connect your PC with a real MOST ring using a MOST Interface (VN26xx). You can also switch to offline mode and analyze logging files.

The configuration presents three features
- Bus load analysis
- Response time analysis
- General bus statistics


Bus load analysis
----------------------------------------
This feature measures the bus load generated by up to 16 different nodes. It is presented on the desktop "Bus Load".

The following values (in msgs/s) are calculated for each node:
- Current
- Floating Average (time span default: 15 s)
- Minimum
- Maximum
Additionally these values are also provided in % of the overall maximum bus load.

These values are provided in 8 different messages, each transferring one of the above mentioned values for all 16 nodes.

You can configure this feature by activating/deactivating and adding/removing signals in the graphics window.
You can change the time span for the floating average in the CAPL program "BusLoad" in the user-function "Init_ConfigurationVariables".


Response time analysis
----------------------------------------
This feature measures response times an the control channel. It is presented on the desktop "Response Time".

To configure this feature you need to configure the MOST Application Filter (MAF) in the measurement setup (desktop "Setup") in front of the CAPL node "ResponseTime". You need to add all request/response pairs you want to analyze to the filter.

The result is displayed in the data window (desktop "Response Time"). The histogram contains 10 normal and 2 special ranges.
The first normal range ("Range 1") starts with the histogram offset (default: 0 ms). Each normal range has the same width (default: 20 ms). Using the default settings, the normal ranges cover response times from 0 to 200 ms divided into 10 ranges.
All response times below "Range 1" are collected in one of the special ranges, all response times above "Range 10" are collected in the other special range.

You can change the offset and the range width in the CAPL program "ResponseTime" in the user-function "Init_ConfigurationVariables".


Bus statistic signals
----------------------------------------
This feature shows how to use bus statistic values in the graphics window. It is presented on the desktop "Bus Statistics".

To configure this feature open the context menu on the graphics window (desktop "Bus Statistics") and select "Add signals ...". In the following dialog you can select some more MOST bus statistic signals.
