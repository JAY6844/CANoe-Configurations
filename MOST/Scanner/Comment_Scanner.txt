MOST Demo: Scanner
*********************************************************************

Requirements
--------------------
An MOST hardwre interface (e.g. VN 2600) is needed, because this 
Demo operates in real-mode. It is configured as Slave and should be
connected to a real MOST bus containing a Network Master.


There are two main desktops in this configuration, which are used to perform a
network (system) and a device specific scan:

Network Scan
------------------
On this desktop the following windows are shown:

- MOST Audio Routing:    This window shows the content of the allocation table. In 
                                         addition you can allocate or deallocate channels.

- MOST Central Registry: This window shows the content of the central registry. After
                                         the NetworkMaster broadcasts Config (Ok), the whole
                                         central registry is requested and display here. You can
                                         request the central registry during measurement by pushing
                                         the button 'Get registry now'.

- MOST State window:     This window shows some hardware related values (e.g. 
                                         light&lock, addresses) of the MOST interface you are using.
                                         In addtion the system state is displayed in the column 
                                         'Config'.
                                         
Furthermore the panel 'MOST Network Scanner' is available for handling some network related stuff:
  - optical wake-up of the MOST network
  - suspending the shutdown procedure of the PowerMaster
  - registering and unregistering of function blocks during measurement
  - registering a 'dummy' function block, since some NetworkMaster expect at least one
    function block per device


Device Scan
------------------

The panel 'MOST Device Scanner' is used for requesting device and function block specific properties.

Scan Device:      You have to specify the device you want to scan by setting the 
                           desired node postion. During the scan, device specific properties 
                           (e.g. addreses, retry parameters) and the function block list are
                           requested via the NetBlock.
                           Additionally you can specify whether to device has an INIC chip
                           or whether some chip registers should be read out via 'RemoteRead'.
                           Note, that the INIC chip does not allow a 'RemoteRead' access!
                           
Scan FBlock:       You have to specify the function block to be scanned by setting the
                           desired functional address (FBlockID + InstID). During the scan
                           function ID list and the notification matrix are read out.
                           Note: You can request any function block of the MOST network you
                                     are currently scnanning!

Scan FBlock ET: This scan should only be performed, if the function block 
                          EnhancedTestability (ET) is available in the device you are scanning.
                          During the scan some device properties (e.g buffer sizes) are 
                          requested.
