MOST High Protocol Multiconnection  Demo Configuration
==================================

Purpose:
----------
This configuration demonstrates the usage of multiple MOST High Protocol connections
in a single node. Additionally, a test module shows how to use the High Protocol DLL 
within a testing application. The demo  is intended as a supplement to the regular 
High Protocol Demo, which is also shipped with this product. If you are more interested
in the general topics of the High Protocol usage, it is recommended that you first take
a look at that demo.

In order to work, the "Exec32" directory of the configuration's folder must contain
the file "MOST_MHP.dll", which is the node layer DLL that implements the protocol.
 
The simulation setup consists of two devices, which are each connected to different
channels. The channels are connected to a virtual MOST ring (if not, activate the
checkbox in Options->Simulation). 

"Device1" contains the node "DSO", which implements the data sources (DSO1 and 
DSO2) for two different  functions of different FBlocks to demonstrate the application 
of callback prefixes (see documentation for further information). Another node 
("DSO 3") is modified with some fault injections and is used as a communication partner
 for the test module. 

"Device2" contains the node "DSI", which is the controller that implements the data
sinks for the two functions (DSI1 and DSI2),  using the same pattern to manage the 
parallel reception of data from the sources.  

Each data source and each data sink has it's own panel to display the data transmitted 
or received. Each panel also displays the symbolic function name of the function it is 
used for. 

Regular Usage
-----------------
For a quick run of the demo, use the DSO panels to  input the number of bytes to be 
transmitted (<= 65536) in the edit box to the left of the "Fill&Send" button and press
"Fill&Send" to start the transmission. Do this for both data sources sequentially. Once
started, the buffer is retransmitted endlessly until the "Stop" button is pressed. By 
this, it is easy to create a situation of two simultaneously running transmissions. 
Alternatively, you can also enter some text in the hex edit control of DSO panels and 
press "Send". 

To try out the test application, switch to the desktop "MHP_Test". Use the test 
control panel to start the test execution. The Panel "FI DSO 3" offers different options 
for triggering faulty behaviour of DSO 3, all of them resulting in a failure of the 
"DSO Test".  Reasons for failure are displayed in the generated test report. 

Customisation I
------------------
Transmission parameters and other settings can't be set directly via panel in this demo, 
since it focuses on showing the handling of multiple connections. However, several
parameters can be configured in the global variable section of the DSO. You can also
change the addresses of the functions used in the demo by changing the addressing 
and the prefixes in the names of the callback functions.
  
Customisation II - Usage of Automatic MHP Receiver
--------------------------------------------------------------
To try out the Automatic MHP Receiver deactivate the DSI node and run the demo as 
described in the "Regular Usage" section.
