-------------------------------- MOST Gateway Demo -------------------------------

The Gateway sample configuration essentially contains all functions of the 
MOSTSystemDemo sample. However, it adds a CAN channel on which additional
simulation functions and the possibility of bus-wide analysis are 
demonstrated.

Enhancements

 * A simple motor simulation controls the volume adjustment depending on speed.
 * An electronic ignition switch that essentially takes over the simulation of the 
   Klemme15.
 * A multifunction steering wheel that allows operation of the multimedia system 
    from the Steering Wheel panel.
 * A Dashboard node that controls the display of multimedia information in the
    instrument cluster.
 * A Gateway module that copies status information (Klemme15) and user actions
    from the CAN side to the MOST ring, and sends the display information from 
    MOST to the instrumentation cluster.
 * The messages from both bus systems are displayed with the synchronized time
    stamps (a synchronization is only necessary for operation in real mode) in 
    chronological order in corresponding trace windows.
 * Checks for gateway devices are demonstrated on desktop Test.
     * The XML module 'Gateway - RequestResponse' supervises the signal passage
        through the gateway with the following conditions:
        MOST message Gateway.CANEvent.Status must succeed CAN message 
          IgnitionKeyStatus within a specified time.
        CAN message TrackStatus must succeed MOST message 
          AudioDiskPlayer.TrackPosition.Status().
        A flexible configuration of the conditions is possible (e.g. timeouts,
        signal/parameter values).
     * The XML module 'Gateway - Fallback' checks the fallback message
        TimeRelative(0) to be send on CAN if 
        AudioDiskPlayer.TimePosition.Status(time) is not reported on MOST for
        a dedicated period of time.
