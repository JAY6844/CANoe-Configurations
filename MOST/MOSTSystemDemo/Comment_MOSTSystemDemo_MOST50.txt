-------------------------- MOST50 System Demo -----------------------------------

This sample works in simulation mode with 3 MOST channels that are 
connected to a virtual ring. A Head Unit, CD changer and amplifier are 
simulated.

Alternatively, this configuration can also be used in real operation
with three MOST50 HW interfaces (e.g. OptolyzerOL3050e).

In this sample configuration, the following functions are shown in the
context of MOST:

* Simulation with CANoe:

   * Connection to a MOST50 HW interface in node mode
   * Simulation of MOST devices in the simulation setup. Each MOST device is 
      represented by a node in the simulation setup. A MOST channel can be
      assigned to each node (desktop Setup and User Interfaces).
   * Simulation of a control console Head Unit for operating the MOST 
      Function Blocks AudioDiskPlayer, AmFmTuner, Navigation, AudioAmplifier.
      The node 'HeadUnit' primarily serves the operation of the configuration. 
      In particular, this CAPL node shows:
      * Receipt of MOST messages
      * Display of data in the Head Unit panel
      * Use of XML catalogs for the symbolic access to signals and messages
         in CAPL.
      * Integration of panels with various control and display elements
      * The use of address handlers for addressing function blocks.
         (The destination address of the message to be sent is mostly left to 
         the default value of 0xFFFF, whereby network services are physically 
         addressed with FblockId and InstId.)
      * Building a controller application with the help of CANoe's Shadow
         Service and Notification Shadow Service.

   * Simulation of the CD changer:
     * This CAPL node shows the simple programming templates, with which a 
        function block can be simulated. In particular, it shows:
        * The use of Notification Services when distributing status changes in 
           the system
        * The use of APIs for responding to command messages with error
           messages (a parameter may contain illegal values).
        * The programming template for implementing a Properties with the 
           MostAsNtfFunctionEnable, SendPropertyStatus,on mostAMSMessage,
           FBlock.Property.Set steps.
        * The usage of CANoe's Function Service to process defualt tasks of
           a FBlock.

* Testing with CANoe:

  The MOSTSystemDemo introduces testing with CANoe as a significant feature.
  
    * The use of a test setup (desktop Test) to place test modules, replay blocks
       and interactive generator blocks for MOST separate from the simulation. 
       These test nodes can be added to each configuration later.
    * XML test module: The comments in the XML files describe which tests are
       executed here. Test results and information about individual test steps can
       be viewed in the test report.
    * CAPL test module: The CAPL test module Tester demonstrates an easy
       way to formulate test sequences in CAPL. The test sequences are thoroughly 
       commented in order to describe the implementation method. After executing 
       the test module, the test report receives detailed information about which test 
       steps were executed with what results.
    * Execution window: The execution window is available to control a test module. 
       In this window, you can select the test steps, start the test and open the test
       report.

* Data analysis with CANoe:
 
  A number of functions are introduced that support the analysis of MOST data.

  * With the help of the desktops, windows can be structurally arranged.
  * In the measurement setup (see desktop Setup), you can add filter blocks to 
     filter events from the bus. 
  * In the MOST Application Filter all kinds of MOST events and messages can 
     be configured individually. Wildcards can be set for most message properties
     (e.g. filter all Error OpTypes).
  * Configure the settings of the trace window.
     * Coloring user defined individual messages or message groups
     * Columns displayed
     * Filter settings
         * Predefined filter
         * Analysis filter, configurable through drag&drop
  * Display of the current status of individual MOST channels in the MOST Status
     window (desktop System View).
  * Display of statistical data in the bus statistics and graphics windows.
  * Display of the bus registry in the Central Registry window (desktop System View).
  * Display of parameter values in the graphics and data window through direct
     selection from the XML function catalog (independent of the transmission method, 
     e.g. with Arrays of Record) (desktop Parameters).
  * Assembly and sending of messages with the interactive generator for MOST. 
      * Addressing with address handler
      * Adding your own node address in a message parameter, e.g. to set notifications
         independent of the ring positions
      * Sending sequences

  * Usage of the MOST High Protocol Nodellayer Dll to transfer data over MOST
     (desktop High Protocol).
