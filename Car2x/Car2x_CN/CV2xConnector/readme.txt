This configuration shows how an UDP Connection can be used to send/receive cellular V2X packets based on chinese 
standards. Use the "UDP Connection Settings" Panel to set up your connection.

The Target IP is the IP address of your C-V2X device. The Tx / Rx ports can be customized to
your preferences. 

The counterpart on the C-V2X modem must be implemented by yourself. 

It is possible to insert up to 20 byte meta data before the C-V2X payload. This can be configured
in the Panel "Meta Data"
