K-Line Demo
======================================================================

Requirements: 
- CANoe 8.0 SP4 or higher
- K-Line capable VN interface or interfaces.
- Two K-Line channels looped with a CANcable0.
- Current driver for VN interfaces.

The demo shows how a K-Line tester and ECU can be simulated.
The K-Line tester is configured and you can use the interactive diagnostic console to send a service.
The ECU simulation is programmed in CAPL. See the CAPL program of the node KLineEcu in the simulation setup.
A K-Line ECU simulation can intialize itself according to the settings in the diagnostics configuration dialog.
CANoe can implement either a tester OR an ECU on one specific K-Line channel.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
How to use:

Start the measurement and send a diagnostics service e.g. ReadEcuIdentification via the diagnostic console.
Observe the response from the ECU in the console, or find a detailed analysis in the trace windows.

Desktop "K-Line Parameters"

Panel "K-Line ECU Settings"

Select between a different header formats. 
Default header is the header setting that is negotiated with the  StartCommunciation service.

The following baud rates can be selected: 10400, 19200, 38400, 57600.
After a StopCommunication service the baudrate is reset to the K-Line default of 10400 which is required for a K-Line fast initialisation.

P1 Time: The inter byte spaces of a Kline ECU response can be set between 0 and 15 ms. Check the value in the trace window (column: interbyte space).


Panel "Response Behavior"

There are two possibilites to influence a simulated response:

- Radio Button "Patched Response": Activates the CAPL Pre_send handler. Before a response is transmitted it can be changed in the Pre_Send handler. 
  In this example the checkesum byte is changed (see CAPL program KLineEcu.can).
- Radio Button "Raw Response": Activates sending a K-Line message as a byte stream. A response can be defined as a pure byte stream that can be sent instead of the default response.
  In this example the response is changed to a response containing more bytes than the default response (see CAPL program KLineEcu.can).
- Radio Button "Default": Resets the response behavior.

Panel "Status Indication Communication Layer ECU"

Shows notifications for:
- the fast init pattern
- received and transmitted bytes
- received and transmitted frames

Desktop "K-Line Testmodule"

- Shows the K-Line test features in a test module. The test module requires default settings in the desktop K-Line Parameters.
