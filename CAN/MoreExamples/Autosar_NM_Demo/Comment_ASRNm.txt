AUTOSAR Network Management 3.3 Protocol Demo
*****************************************
Use 1024*768 pixel resolution for optimal usage of this demo.

This example demonstrates how to use the AUTOSAR Network Management
node layer module in CANoe, and in particular the partial networking feature
that was introduced with AUTOSAR 3.2.

Five nodes (Nodes A-D, and a node called "Gateway") are included in the
simulation setup. For each node there is an entry in the database indicating
that the node utilizes the AUTOSAR NM nodelayer DLL. Other node attributes 
configure address and timing information for the NM layer of the specific node.

The user can configure the state of the nodes A-D via panels. This includes
changing the network request state, the NM configuration ("Active Mode",
"Communication", "Partial Networking") and setting the user data and the
control bit vector sent. It is also possible to display the received user data
and to order the node to go to "Repeat Message" mode, which will trigger
the detection of other nodes. The detected nodes are displayed via LEDs in
the panel. Furthermore, the current NM state, the "Repeat Message" state
and reception of the "Car Wakeup" bit are displayed at the top of the panel.

Because the four main nodes belong to different partial networks, a network
request from one of them will not necessarily wake up all other nodes.
The requested partial networks are denoted next to the "Network Request"
button. The "Gateway" node fills a special role, having the ability to request
both partial networks and to send the "Car Wakeup" bit to all nodes. The
user can control the Gateway node via panel, too. Note that if no action is
triggered in this panel, the gateway node is passive and will not participate
in the message transfer.

The special settings for this demo configuration are stored in the file
"CAN_AsrNM33.ini" within the demo folder, e.g. the node specific information
regarding partial networking.
