CANoe demo showing ISO TP on CAN functionality
**********************************************

Main Features:
- Multi-channel configuration
- CAN FD support and Jumbo frames (ISO 15765-2/2013)

Four nodes (Nodes A-D) are included in the simulation setup. Each of them 
uses the OSEK TP node layer DLL to communicate with other nodes via two connections (connection 1 and 2). 

When CAN FD is active (default), TP connection may be configured to use CAN FD frames of 8 to 64 byte length.
Note that sender AND receiver must be set to (any) CAN FD setting, otherwise the received will ignore CAN FD frames!

Jumbo frames are also available when CAN FD is active, but the "Max. receive length" must be increased to allow reception of >4095 bytes.

On the "Node Panels" desktop there is a separate panel for each node which enables setting address information for the connections. The default address setting 
establishes the following connectivity: A1-B1, A2-B2, C1-D1, C2-D2. Note that the address information that is actually used (Tx/Rx identifier or ECU/target address) depends on the addressing mode.

Data to be sent to another node has to be entered into the lower hex/text editor either manually or using the "Auto Fill" button. Transmission is started after the "Send Data" button of one of the two connections has been pressed. On successful 
transmission the received data (including the number of bytes) is displayed in the upper hex/text editor control in the panel representing the destination node. Flashing  "Tx"/"Rx" LEDs on both connection ends indicate ongoing transmission. The LEDs stay 
on for some seconds after transmission has succeeded. If an error occurs the corresponding "Err" LED flashes.

Detailed connection settings including addressing mode, additional addressing parameters, and flow control parameters are available via the corresponding "Settings" button. The settings can be configured individually for each connection. The 
"Apply to all connections" button copies the settings to all connections in all nodes. Global settings can also be modified via the "GlobalConnectionSettings" panel on the "Main" desktop.

The messages exchanged during data transmission can be viewed in the trace window on the "Main" desktop. If  "Show debug info in Write window" is enabled in the “Debug Info” panel additional information is printed in the write window, when the parameters 
of a connection are modified or if one of the CanTP callback functions (first frame indication, reception indication, send confirmation, error indication) is called.

The mapping from settings made in the panels and the CanTP API functions providing the interface to the osek_tp.dll is done in CAPL programs. The following features are used there to increase code efficiency and ease maintenance:
-	CAPL include files
-	macros
-	system variable programming using nested namespaces

Note that in this configuration apart from the message names and the DLL assignment no further information from the database is used.
