Help comments to the CAPL Debug demo
===============================

The CAPL debugger can be used to display variables during runtime 
and to stop the simulation by means of breakpoints or CAPL instructions.

A simple CAPL node is linked with a debug panel. Activating the 
individual pushbuttons makes it possible to set the halt() and inspect()
instructions that are built into the CAPL program code and then to 
reset them again.

After the BreakPoints( halt() ) have been activated, you must press 
"Start" button to continue with the simulation; or you
can use the buttons in the Debugger window to step and continue.

When you are setting the inspect() function, it can only be turned 
off again with the panel switch.
